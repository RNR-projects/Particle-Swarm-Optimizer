Utilizes particle swarm optimization to output the "best" streetlight layout on a stretch of straight road in the Philippines with respect to:
- Streetlight arrangement (alternating, only one side, paired on both sides)
- Position and height of the buildings surrounding within 5 meters of both sides of the road
- Orientation of the road relative to the Northern direction
- Minimum illuminance at any point of the road
- Target average illuminance of the road
- Height limit of the streetlights if applicable
- Limit of the total amount of streetlights intended for the road
- Minimum annual energy generated by the solar panel

Made in Unity Engine due to my familiarity with it and to more easily visualize the whole process and to make use of raycasting for calculating the effect of building shadows on energy generation.
